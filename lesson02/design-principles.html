        <h2>Alignment</h2>
        <h3><a href="https://www.vw.com/en.html" target="_blank">vw.com</a></h3>

        <p>
            I think the Voltswagen mobile website is a great example of 
            alignment because you can tell what is related just by following 
            the lines. Everything is left-aligned and it gives the whole 
            website an official feel.

    <section class="proximity">
        <h2>Proximity</h2>
        <h3><a href="https://www.ulta.com/" target="_blank">ulta.com</a></h3>
        <img src="images/ulta.PNG" alt="ulta mobile">
        <p>
            The Ulta website exemplifies proximity because it uses 
            proximity to give you a lot of information without being 
            confused. As you can see, it shows you information about
            the product right underneath that product and away from the
            others.

    <section class="repetition">
        <h2>Repetition</h2>
        <h3><a href="https://www.budgetbytes.com/" target="_blank">budgetbytes.com</a></h3>
        <img src="images/budgetbytes.PNG" alt="budgetbytes mobile">
        <p>
            Budget Bytes is one of my favorite websites because it uses
            repitition so well. It only uses one font but consistently 
            bolds the titles. It also is very monochrome exept for an orange
            accent here or there.
